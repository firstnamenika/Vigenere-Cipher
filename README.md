This is a small project that implements the Vigen√®re Cipher for encoding and decoding text in Python.

Running this script requires Python-friendly code editor or IDE.

The program will prompt a user to enter some text and a code word. After encoding or decoding is completed, the program will ask whether the user has a different text to rework.

This was challenging to solve, but I found the process entertaining nevertheless.
